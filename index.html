    <h2><b>A Brewing Unrest</b></h2>
      <p2>The story of labor relations in America is filled with strife, conflict, and at times seems like an unending back-and-forth between workers and their employers. Ever since the Industrial Revolution and the need for cheap, unskilled laborers, unions have fought against policies and practices that hold employees in a lower regard. Pittsburgh, having been built on the backs of Pennsylvanian steel workers and headed by titans of industry is no exception, with countless instances of conflict between workers and owners. Some of the most influential and groundbreaking strikes in early industrial America were brewed right within the city. 
      The Allegheny Textile Strike of 1845 garnered significant media affection, as textile workers within the city, including women and children, refused to work long and unreasonable hours, culminating in pro union legislation being passed (Martinek).  Among the textile strikes, there were countless other demonstrations and strikes, which never slowed down as the years went on. These events created the conditions in 19th century Pittsburgh that allowed for so much unrest among the city's workers. Pittsburgh had garnered a reputation for significant class conflict within the region, and solidified itself to this day as a distinctly blue-collar city. The workers of Pittsburgh were eager for change, and they had a track record of fighting for what they wanted.

      <p><i>“Frick writes on the Homestead strike, the arrival of Pinkerton men, strike breakers, and newspaper sympathy for the strikers”</i></p>
    </div>
  


<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2><b>A Piece of History</b></h2>
    <p2>The piece “Frick writes on the Homestead strike, the arrival of Pinkerton men, strike breakers, and newspaper sympathy for the strikers,” a correspondence between two prominent business leaders, shows a perspective in direct opposition to the ongoing Homestead strike and the workers participating in it. Authored in July of 1892, it is a letter from Henry Clay Frick sent to Andrew Carnegie regarding the ongoing strike and the pro-company countermeasures put in place. Preceding one of the most important events in United States labor history, the Homestead Massacre (Adamzyck, 2018), the archive provides critical context for the events set to happen thereafter. 
    The piece is critical in understanding the character of Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, key players in Pittsburgh’s politics and labor relations. It’s rare to get an insight between powerful men, but putting together their relationship, their business practices, and their attitudes towards workers reveals much about these men, and the labor movements surrounding their industries. More is said in this letter than could ever be read in public statements or comments to the press.

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2><b>A Deeper Dive</b></h2>
    <p2>Throughout the letter, Frick writes in a remarkably casual way for a titan of industry. He speaks as a friend, and casually dismisses the workers and any threat they may pose. He writes “I think we have everything in about as good shape as can be,” in regards to the striking workers, and gives no further explanation on the potential consequences of the disruption. His warm demeanor and lack of professionalism furthers this, as it is clear Frick views the strike as a curious event to let an old friend know about, not a serious concern that could spark similar sentiment in other factories.
    The other obvious takeaway is Frick’s lack of sympathy for his employees. When he does mention them he uses objective, dehumanizing terms like “workmen” and does not claim ownership over them as employees. He has more care for those sent to break the strike, and at one point even calls the factory workers “enemies.” It’s also notable that he does not mention the demands of the workers, and has no concern for a peaceful resolution, choosing to replace and intimidate. Throughout the text the only real concern he expresses is over his own public reputation, and worries about the media and public outcry that could come from his actions.

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2><b>Patterns Repeating</b></h2>
    <p>This letter, among many other things, highlights how unsympathetic and uncaring those at the top were, and are. We all know that a corporation's main objective is to make money, but reading this correspondence shows just how ingrained that sentiment is into the owners and stakeholders. Frick’s letter to Carnegie is more than just a piece of a conversation, it’s a display of everything wrong with corporate America, the greed, the impersonality, and the lack of regard for human livelihoods. This goes doubly for the Carnegie Steel Company, which at the time was the most profitable steel company in America (Gordon, 2023). This letter is not just a relic of an old America, but an indication of the corporate attitudes towards workers and the lower class we see today. Countless letters, phone calls, emails, texts, and conversations to this day have and will echo the sentiments held by these men all the way back since 1891. Understanding the grim tragedy that happened shortly after this letter was sent, and peeling back the curtain to see how cold and remorseless the people orchestrating it truly were, is critical for following modern labor relations.

  <h2><b>Moving Forward</b></h2>
    <p>With this in mind, how can we, as responsible citizens and workers, apply the surface level findings in the document to our lives? To start, sharing documents like these and exposing the ugly underbelly of corporate America will do wonders in encouraging reform. With each person who cares about change, comes a bigger chance to actually create a difference. We can also use documents like these as starting points in a journey of education and exploration, gaining a full understanding of the power dynamic and consequences of a capitalist system. Ultimately, what at a first glance appears to be a faded letter from two long dead men carries with it more significance than could ever be seen on a surface level. Understanding this is the responsibility of the reader, but the societal change that this letter demands can only be brought about by the public.
